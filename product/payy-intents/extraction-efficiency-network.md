# Extraction Efficiency Network

## Gas Optimization

EEN reduces gas costs through smarter execution.

| Token Tier | Gas Efficiency                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| All users  | Standard bundling                       |
| 100+       | +15% savings (batching)                 |
| 1k+        | +35% savings (bundling + optimization)  |
| 10k+       | +60% savings (custom RPCs)              |
| 100k+      | +85% savings (validator-direct routing) |

## MEV Protection

| Token Tier | MEV Protection                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| All users  | Basic sandwich protection through private execution     |
| 100+       | Enhanced private execution (0.2% saved per transaction) |
| 1k+        | Advanced private execution (0.4% saved per transaction) |
| 10k+       | Full MEV protection with priority inclusion             |
| 100k+      | Direct builder submission with maximum priority         |

## Multi-chain Efficiency Scaling

| Token Tier | MEV Protection                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All users  | -                                                                  |
| 100+       | Automatic cross-chain routing for optimal gas costs                |
| 1k+        | Intelligent yield deployment based on real-time gas analysis       |
| 10k+       | Transaction batching across loops to minimize operational overhead |
| 100k+      | Yield threshold enforcement (no harvest below 2x gas cost)         |
