# Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the requirements and design for a privacy preserving Ethereum L2 zero knowledge rollup with built in privacy and compliance. We presented the underlying zero knowledge proof algorithms that enable secure and privacy preserving off-chain transactions, as well as the mechanism for transmitting and sending notes. For the first time, the Payy Network protocol provides the necessary infrastructure to private financial transactions that are privacy preserving yet compliant.
