# Bridging

Since [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") is an entirely separate blockchain, tokens (like [usdc.md](stablecoins/usdc.md "mention")) from other chains need to be bridged to it.

The first bridge we have deployed is on Polygon (see [contract-addresses.md](../support/contract-addresses.md "mention")) and it enables seamless deposits and withdrawals from multiple blockchains by using cross-chain protocols. Also see the Payy Network [audits.md](../support/audits.md "mention").
