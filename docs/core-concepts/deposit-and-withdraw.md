# Deposit & withdraw

There are two main ways to deposit and withdraw from Payy:

1. Fiat from your bank
2. Crypto from other blockchains

## Fiat

Fiat deposits are available in Argentina and the US (beta). When you connect your bank and deposit funds, your fiat money (ARS, USD, etc) will be converted to [stablecoins](stablecoins/ "mention") and deposited to your Payy balance.

We use multiple Fiat <> Stablecoin partners under the hood to achieve coverage across different geographic regions. All of our partners are licensed and regulated to offer these services where they operate.

## Crypto

You can deposit multiple tokens from multiple chains to Payy. Tokens will be bridge and swapped to USDC on Payy Network.&#x20;

Crypto deposits are self-custodied by your Payy Wallet because it controls addresses on multiple chains and automates your deposit intent through multiple protocols and bridges. You can view and export your deposit address keys in Advanced Settings.

Payy Network integrates two cross-chain protocols: Across and Mayan. Both of these protocols run through our Polygon lock-and-mint bridge.
