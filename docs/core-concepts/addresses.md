# Addresses

## Payy Address

This is your public/private keypair for [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"). Your Payy Address is never revealed as part of the transaction data the wallet sends to the network.

## Deposit Addresses

These are addresses that your Payy Wallet controls for other blockchains so it can non-custodially automate swapping and bridging from those networks. For example, when you deposit USDC from Polygon, you send tokens to your deposit address, which is picked up by your Payy Wallet and bridged to Payy Network (see [bridging.md](bridging.md "mention")).&#x20;
