# Privacy

In [06\_compliance.md](../payy-network/06_compliance.md "mention")we discuss various approaches to compliant privacy. We aim to keep the design space open so we can adapt to changing technology and laws.

The solution weâ€™ve chosen for now is called UTXO lineage. For a given UTXO note, all of its past parent notes can be traced. However, the transaction amount, sending address and receiving address are still never revealed publicly. This is a unique capability that a UTXO based model has that an account based model like Ethereum cannot enable.
