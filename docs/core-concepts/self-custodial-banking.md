# Self-custodial banking

Instead of depositing funds at a traditional bank, you can now store funds in Payy Wallet with security and access guaranteed by cryptography.

To provide bank-like services such as savings, stablecoin payments, wire transfers, Visa cards and interest, Payy uses a combination of decentralized blockchain systems and regulated partners.

Neither Payy nor [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") have a banking license in any country. In fact â€” Payy Wallet is simply software that allows users to manage cryptographic keys, sign transactions and interface with blockchains, protcols and partner services.

At no point does Payy Wallet or Polybase Labs have unilateral custody of your funds.

Before [blockchains.md](blockchains.md "mention"), self-custodial banking was not possible. The implementation of a trustless globally distributed ledger by Bitcoin pioneered the idea that you could have full control over your digital money: no restrictions, no freezes, no bank runs.
