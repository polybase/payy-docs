# Welcome to Payy

Payy is building the first onchain bank for all of humanity by vertically integrating stablecoins, a bespoke, privacy-preserving blockchain, global fiat ramps, payment cards and cross-chain DeFi — all accessible through a seamless app that just works.

Onchain banking was not possible before because blockchains like Ethereum and Solana lack usable privacy (no one wants their bank transactions public) and user experience (gas is so 2016, switching chains is so 2023).

Payy solves this with a deep technical stack enabling the first self-custodial consumer bank — available to everyone, anywhere in the world.

This isn’t just a vision, you can use it today.

Get your paycheck directly in Payy, buy a coffee, and invest to grow your savings. For the first time in human history, Payy enables a universal, end-to-end money experience that is seamless and safe.

Simply put: Payy is Easy Money
