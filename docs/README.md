# Welcome to Payy

Payy is building onchain consumer banking.

We’re vertically integrating stablecoins, a privacy-preserving blockchain, global fiat ramps, payment cards and cross-chain DeFi — all accessible through a single interface for businesses and consumers.

Stablecoin adoption will push trillions of dollars onchain, but there’s a massive problem: _**all transactions are public forever.**_&#x20;

As blockchain data is inevitably analyzed and exploited, consumers and businesses become desperate for privacy. Traditional onchain privacy protocols are complex, unsafe, and unusable by the next billion onchain users.

Payy enables onchain banking with two main components: [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") and [payy-wallet.md](product/payy-wallet.md "mention").

> PS: we're hiring for [marketing](https://polybase.notion.site/Head-of-Marketing-fa176c7548b944d4870fa4bab9b58ddc) and [engineering](https://polybase.notion.site/Staff-Fullstack-Engineer-Rust-React-06175a647cd2447881f2bc20dcdc6db7).
