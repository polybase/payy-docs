# About

Polybase Labs is the company building Payy Wallet and Payy Network.

Polybase Labs was founded in 2022 by Sid Gandhi and Calum Moore out of their frustration with the lack of real world impact made by blockchain projects since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. They have shipped products to millions of people at Apple and Virgin Media, contributed to multiple blockchain projects such as ZK Bench and Polybase DB as well as given talks at major crypto conferences (EthCC and ZK Summit).
