Payy is a next-generation onchain bank account that’s:

* Free to use: No fees for sending, receiving or transferring in/out.
* Simple but powerful: You can use it as a global cash account — or dive into investments (coming soon).
* Safe and secure: You can't be debanked, transactions are confidential and keys auto-backup.

To get started, download Payy Wallet for iOS or Android.
