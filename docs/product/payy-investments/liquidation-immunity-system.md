# Liquidation Immunity System

## Auto protection system

Everyone gets auto-deleveraging when their collateral ratio gets too risky. But if you hold more $PAYY, the system checks your risk level more often and acts faster.

## Auto-deleveraging Tiers

The system can adjust your safe borrowing limit based on how many tokens you hold.

## Yield Buffer Allocation

Each userâ€™s yield contributes to a protection pool. This acts like an insurance fund to protect against market volatility or sudden crashes.
