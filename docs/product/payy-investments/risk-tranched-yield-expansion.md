# Risk-tranched Yield Expansion

A structured yield system that lets users choose how much risk they want to take — similar to how bond tranches or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) work in traditional finance.

| Tranche   | Base yield | Principal protection |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Senior    | 70%        | 98%                  |
| Mezzanine | 100%       | standard risk        |
| Junior    | 130-180%   | high risk            |

## $PAYY token yield boosts

Boosts are redistributed from the system’s overall earnings and designed incentives:

1. Protocol fees being partially redistributed to reward $PAYY holders
2. Risk/reward rebalancing across tranches
3. Treasury yield and protocol capital subsidizing boosts
4. Long-term token scarcity, making each boost more valuable
