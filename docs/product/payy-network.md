# Payy Network

Payy Network is currently implemented as a single-sequencer validium rollup. It aggregates UTXO transaction proofs submited by Payy Wallet and posts them to a base layer.

Payy Network is built from scratch in-house by Polybase Labs. Read more in the [whitepaper](../payy-network/whitepaper.md).

To view network activity, see the explorer: [https://payy.network/explorer](https://payy.network/explorer). Note that transactions are only visible as a hash and proof as the actual transaction data is private on the user's device.
