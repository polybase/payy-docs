## Card type

* Issuer: U.S.-based
* Network: Visa (Platinum)
* Card classification: Secured credit card (spending is limited to your Payy Wallet balance)
* Form factors: Virtual and physical

## Identity verification

* [identity-verification.md](../../core-concepts/identity-verification.md "mention") is required to receive a card
* Your identity and verification data cannot be linked to your Payy Network blockchain transactions
* Information we have to collect varies between countries but generally its your name, birth date, address, government ID number and ID photo.

## Usage notes

* In-store: Use Apple Pay, Google Pay, or the [physical card](light-up-card.md) (contactless only)
* Online: Use the card number directly
* Virtual card: Must be added to Apple/Google Pay manually
* Deposits: You can fund your Payy Wallet from bank accounts in the U.S. and Argentina (more countries coming soon)
* Cross-border support: Some online merchants in certain countries may reject U.S.-issued cards
* Non USD purchases: Purchases denominated in currencies other than USD have a 1% foreign exchange fee (probably better than your bank).

## Adding to Apple Pay or Google Pay

You can add Payy Card to Apple Pay or Google Pay by going to the Apple Wallet or Google Wallet app. Add a new credit card and enter your Payy Card details to activate.

## How Payy Card Privacy works

[Broken link](broken-reference "mention") uses [05\_utxo.md](../../payy-network/05_utxo.md "mention") transactions and doesn't publicly expose your address or transaction values. This means your "tradfi" Visa payments data can never be linked to your Payy Network balance. Every time you make a purchase with your Payy Card, there is a Payy Network transaction that debits the purchase amount from your UTXO notes.
