# $PAYY tokenomics

$PAYY will be used as economic stake to secure Payy Network. Holding $PAYY will also give users tiered benefits — better yield, credit and execution.

* Easy for normal users (just send, save, spend — no fees).
* Powerful for advanced users (tiered yield, leverage, more privacy, and optimization).
* Profitable for big players (serious extraction mechanics and capital efficiency).
* Aligned for everyone: the more you participate or hold $PAYY, the better the system works for you.
